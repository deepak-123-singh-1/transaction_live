1. data lock with public key = open by private key
2. data lock with private key = open by public key


ex - 1st user write "hello" message and lock by public key then message send to 2nd user,
     2nd user red message by self private key === not secure


secure = 1st user message lock by "2nd user public key" and "1st user privat key" then message send
	 2nd use unlock by "1st user public key" and "2nd user self private key"
